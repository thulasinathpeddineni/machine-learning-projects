Alzheimer's Disease Detection
This repository contains the code and methodology for detecting Alzheimer's disease using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The system integrates demographic and clinical data with neuroimaging data (MRI/PET scans) to predict the presence of Alzheimer's disease at an early stage. The project uses models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to process the data.

Project Overview
This project aims to build an Alzheimer's disease detection system by combining clinical and neuroimaging data. The system provides a prediction based on:

Clinical features such as age, gender, cognitive scores, and medical history.

Neuroimaging data obtained from MRI or PET scans, processed with deep learning algorithms.

The goal is to detect Alzheimer’s disease in its early stages, enabling early intervention and more effective treatment.

Installation Instructions
Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

Python 3.x

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

tensorflow or keras (for deep learning models)

numpy

opencv-python (for image processing)

Installation Steps
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alzheimers-disease-detection.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:


cd alzheimers-disease-detection
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

bash
Copy
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Running the model
Prepare your data: Ensure that the clinical data and neuroimaging data are in the required format (CSV for clinical data and DICOM/PNG for images).

Train the model: Run the training script to train both the machine learning and deep learning models:

bash
Copy
python train_model.py
Evaluate the model: After training, use the evaluation script to check the model's performance on the test set:

bash
Copy
python evaluate_model.py
Make Predictions: Use the trained model to predict Alzheimer's disease status for new patients:

bash
Copy
python predict.py --data "new_patient_data.csv"
Visualizing the Results
You can visualize model performance using the following command:

bash
Copy
python plot_results.py
This will generate various plots such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importance graphs.

Data
The dataset used in this project consists of two primary components:

Demographic and clinical data: Includes features like age, gender, cognitive test results, medical history, and lifestyle factors.

Neuroimaging data: Includes MRI or PET scans used for deep learning analysis.

You can obtain sample data files by following the instructions in the data folder.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:

Handling missing values.

Normalizing continuous variables.

Encoding categorical data.

Image resizing and normalization for neuroimaging data.

Model Development
Machine Learning Models
We use several machine learning models to predict Alzheimer’s disease based on the clinical data:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Deep Learning Models
The system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze neuroimaging data. The following CNN architectures are used:

VGG16

ResNet50

InceptionV3

The deep learning models are pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned for Alzheimer’s disease prediction using the collected dataset.

Visualizations
Visualizations are key to understanding model performance and the relationship between different features. The following types of visualizations are included in the project:

Pairplot to visualize pairwise relationships between numeric features.

Correlation heatmap to analyze correlations between numerical variables.

Histograms and boxplots for feature distribution.

Confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.
